### Overview
The stream-viewer element is a GUI tool used for viewing image data that is written to a stream. 
It works with the realsense element's color and depth streams and is a useful tool for testing and debugging computer vision algorithms.

### Usage
Since this element utilizes a GUI, we need to forward the display between Docker and the host machine.
This command will allow the root user in the container to have access to the X Server. Run this command on the host machine.
```
xhost +SI:localuser:root
```
Then start the element following the usual steps.

### Usage with realsense element
Start this element in conjunction with the realsense element.


### Usage with your own image streams
Currently, stream-viewer will list all available streams in the atom system, but can only view streams with data of a specific format. Specifically, this element expects a tif encoded image written to a stream with the key to the image as `data`
This can be done in Python as follows
```
_, tif_img = cv2.imencode(".tif", img)
element.entry_write("img", {"data": tif_img.tobytes()}, maxlen=30)
```
Where `img` is an OpenCV image.
